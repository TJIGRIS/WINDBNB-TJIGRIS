- Where can I see your demo?

The web application can be seen in my github and on the devchallenges page.

- What was your experience?

I liked to test my capabilities and see that I can do this, but I am a little upset because I did not manage to do well the filter component and what is inside it, it works correctly but for me it is not very practical the way I did that part, with the other components if I am satisfied because I used good practices.

- What have you learned/improved?

Improved my time by doing these projects and bug fixes.

- Your wisdom? :)

Don't give up until the end
